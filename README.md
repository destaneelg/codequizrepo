## User Story

```
As a  beginning developer I want to text my knowledge of JavaScript  with a  quiz
```

##Website Functionality

```
GIVEN The score is set to zero and no questions appear when the browser loads
WHEN The start button  is pressed the timer starts and questions appear
THEN For each question missed time is lost, for each correct question a point is  added


```
The following screenshot demonstrates the application functionality: assets/codequiz.png

## Obstacles faced during development
```
Lack of knowledge of functions causing code to fail. Will return with  more knowledge.
```
## Instructions for future development
```
I would like to redo this project with functionality to the quiz.
